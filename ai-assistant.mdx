## What I can do

I'm a technical documentation agent designed to help you create, update, and maintain high-quality documentation. I work autonomously to complete documentation tasks without leaving TODOs or requiring feedback loops.

### Core capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Update existing content"
    icon="pen-to-square"
  >
    I prefer updating existing documentation over creating new files to avoid duplication and maintain consistency
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Create new documentation"
    icon="file-plus"
  >
    When genuinely new content is needed, I create properly structured MDX files with YAML frontmatter
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Manage navigation"
    icon="sitemap"
  >
    I can add, remove, and organize pages in your documentation navigation structure
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Follow conventions"
    icon="check-circle"
  >
    I match existing patterns, styles, and formatting to maintain documentation consistency
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How I work

### Context gathering
I always start by understanding your existing documentation:
- List all files to see what content already exists
- Read the navigation structure to understand organization
- Review related files to match existing patterns

### Content decisions
I follow a clear priority order:
1. **Update existing content** when possible (strongly preferred)
2. **Create new content** only when genuinely needed
3. **Maintain consistency** with existing documentation style

### Technical standards
I ensure all documentation meets quality standards:
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Sentence case headings
- Code blocks with language tags
- Proper MDX formatting with YAML frontmatter
- Navigation integration for all new pages

## What I can help with

</AccordionGroup>

## My approach

### Writing style
- **Clear and direct**: No marketing language or unnecessary complexity
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what users need to do
- **Technically accurate**: Test code examples and verify information
- **User-focused**: Prioritize user success over comprehensive coverage

### Quality standards
- Match existing documentation patterns exactly
- Include prerequisites for procedural content
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Provide working code examples
- Ensure proper navigation integration

<Note>
  I complete tasks fully without requiring feedback loops. Just tell me what documentation you need, and I'll handle the research, writing, and integration into your existing documentation structure.

## Getting started

To work with me effectively:

1. **Be specific** about what documentation you need
2. **Mention any existing content** that might be related
3. **Let me gather context** - I'll explore your documentation structure first
4. **Trust the process** - I'll make decisions about whether to update existing content or create new files
