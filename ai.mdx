## Getting started

Most AI optimization features work automatically with zero configuration:

1. **llms.txt files** are generated automatically for all documentation sites
2. **Markdown export** is available on every page with the `.md` URL extension
3. **MCP servers** are hosted automatically for public documentation

To enable user-facing features:

1. Add the [contextual menu](/ai/contextual-menu) to help users copy content and connect to AI tools
2. Set up the [Slack app](/ai/slack-app) to bring documentation search into your team chat
3. Configure [MCP tools](/ai/model-context-protocol) to expose API endpoints for AI interactions
