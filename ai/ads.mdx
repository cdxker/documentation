AI Ads allows you to seamlessly integrate intelligent advertising solutions into your documentation platform. Leverage artificial intelligence to deliver personalized, contextually relevant advertisements that enhance user experience while generating revenue.

## Overview

AI Ads uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, content context, and browsing patterns to serve the most relevant advertisements. This results in higher engagement rates, better user experience, and increased revenue potential.

### Key Features

- **Contextual Targeting**: Ads are matched to the content users are currently viewing
- **Behavioral Analysis**: AI learns from user interactions to improve ad relevance
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Ads are seamlessly integrated into your documentation layout
- **Performance Analytics**: Real-time insights into ad performance and user engagement
- **Revenue Optimization**: AI automatically adjusts ad placement and timing for maximum revenue

## Getting Started

To enable AI Ads in your documentation, you'll need to configure the advertising settings in your `docs.json` file.

```json
{
  "ads": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "ai-ads",
    "settings": {
      "contextual": true,
      "behavioral": true,
      "placement": "auto"
    }
  }
}
```

## Ad Placement

### Automatic Placement

When using automatic placement, AI Ads will intelligently determine the optimal locations for advertisements based on:

- Content length and structure
- User scroll behavior
- Page engagement metrics
- Historical performance data

### Manual Placement

For more control, you can manually place ads using the `<AdUnit>` component:

```mdx
<AdUnit 
  type="banner" 
  size="medium" 
  contextual={true}
/>
```

### Sidebar Integration

Enable sidebar ads to display relevant advertisements alongside your content:

```json
{
  "ads": {
    "sidebar": {
      "enabled": true,
      "position": "right",
      "size": "large"
    }
  }
}
```
