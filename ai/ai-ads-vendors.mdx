AI ads vendors help you monetize your documentation by displaying relevant, contextual advertisements powered by artificial intelligence. These vendors use machine learning to match ads with your content and audience, creating revenue opportunities while maintaining user experience.

## How AI ads work

AI advertising platforms analyze your documentation content and visitor behavior to serve targeted advertisements. The AI considers factors like:

- **Content relevance** - Matching ads to the topics and technologies discussed on each page
- **User intent** - Understanding what visitors are trying to accomplish
- **Contextual signals** - Using page metadata, headings, and semantic content analysis
- **Audience segmentation** - Targeting based on user characteristics and behavior patterns
