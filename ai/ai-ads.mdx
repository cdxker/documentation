description: Monetize your documentation with AI-powered contextual advertising
---

Use AI ads to generate revenue from your documentation through intelligent, contextual advertising that enhances rather than disrupts the user experience.

## Overview

AI ads leverage machine learning to display relevant advertisements based on your documentation content and user behavior. The system analyzes page content, user engagement patterns, and contextual signals to serve targeted ads that align with your audience's interests.

## Setup

Add the AI ads configuration to your `docs.json` file:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "aiAds": {
      "enabled": true,
      "provider": "mintlify",
      "placement": ["sidebar", "inline", "footer"],
      "targeting": {
        "contextual": true,
        "behavioral": true,
        "geographic": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration options
