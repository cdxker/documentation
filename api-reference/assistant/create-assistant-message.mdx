## Credit usage

Each API call to create an assistant message consumes 1 [AI assistant credit](/guides/assistant#ai-assistant-credits) from your monthly allowance. Monitor your API usage alongside other AI features in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant).

## Rate limits

The assistant API has the following limits:

- 10,000 uses per key per month
- 10,000 requests per Mintlify organization per hour
- 10,000 requests per IP per day

## Suggested usage

For best results, use the [useChat hook from ai-sdk](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#usechat) to send requests and handle responses.

You can set `fp`, `threadId`, and `filter` in the `body` field of the options parameter passed to the hook.
