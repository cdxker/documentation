## When to use branches

Branches let you work on changes without affecting the content on your live site. When your changes are ready, you can merge them into your deployment branch with a pull request.

**Best practice: Always work from branches.** This ensures your live documentation stays stable and enables proper review workflows.

## Creating a branch

1. Select the branch name in the editor toolbar (usually `main` by default).
2. Select **New Branch**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your branch like `update-getting-started` or `fix-installation-steps`.
4. Select **Create Branch**.

<Note>
  You may need to select your new branch from the dropdown menu if the editor does not automatically switch to it.
</Note>

## Saving changes on a branch

To save your changes on a branch, select the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner of the editor. This creates a commit with your changes and pushes it to your branch.

## Switching branches

1. Select the current branch name in the editor toolbar.
2. Select the branch you want to switch to from the dropdown menu.

<Tip>
  Any unsaved changes will be lost when switching branches. Make sure to save or publish your work before switching.
</Tip>

## Branch naming best practices

Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of your branch:

- **Feature branches**: `feature/add-api-docs`, `feature/new-tutorial`
- **Fix branches**: `fix/broken-links`, `fix/typo-in-quickstart`
- **Update branches**: `update/installation-guide`, `update/screenshots`
- **Content branches**: `content/user-guide`, `content/faq-section`

## Working with multiple branches

- **Keep branches focused**: Each branch should address a specific task or feature
- **Regular updates**: Periodically sync your branch with the main branch to avoid conflicts
- **Clean up**: Delete branches after they've been merged to keep your repository organized
