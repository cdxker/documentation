## Introduction

The web editor is a visual interface for creating, editing, and reviewing documentation directly in your browser.

- **Visual editing**: Make changes to your documentation using a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor that shows how your content will look when published.
- **Git synchronization**: All changes automatically sync with your Git repository to maintain version control.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on documentation simultaneously, with changes visible to everyone.
- **No setup required**: Start writing immediately from your dashboard.

## Your first edit workflow

Follow these steps to make your first edit in the web editor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your branch">
    Create a branch or make changes directly to your deployment branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your file">
    Navigate to an existing file or create a new one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your content">
    Make changes in the web editor using either visual mode or Markdown mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview your changes">
    See how your changes will appear in visual mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your changes">
    If you're working on your deployment branch, publish your changes directly from the web editor. On other branches, publish your changes through a pull request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor modes

The web editor has two modes to accommodate different editing preferences and needs.

You can switch between modes at any time using the toggle in the top right corner of the editor toolbar.

### Visual mode

Visual mode provides a WYSIWYG experience where the changes that you make in the editor are the changes that will be published to your documentation site. This mode is ideal for when you want to see how your changes will look in real-time.

    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Markdown mode

Markdown mode provides direct access to the underlying `MDX` code of your documentation. `MDX` combines Markdown syntax with React components, giving you full control over your content structure. This mode is ideal for when you need precise control over component properties or when you prefer to write in Markdown syntax.
