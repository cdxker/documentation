## Performance optimization

### For large repositories

- **Use file search**: Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) to quickly find files instead of browsing
- **Work in focused sessions**: Edit one section at a time rather than keeping multiple files open
- **Regular saves**: Save your work frequently to avoid losing changes

### For slow loading

- **Check network connection**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- **Close unnecessary browser tabs**: Free up browser memory
- **Use supported browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge work best
